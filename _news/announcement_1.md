We seek expressions of interest (EOI) from highly motivated candidates interested in pursuing a PhD degree in internet-of-thing (IoT)-based food supply chain management systems. This project aims to develop an monitoring and control system to maintain the quality of perishable goods during transport and handling from farms to shops.

Applicants are required to have achieved honours class one or have other equivalent research based qualifications. Applicants with Weighted Average Mark (WAM) higher than 75 will also be considered. Applicants are also expected to have good knowledge in communication networks, signal processing, and embedded systems, with strong interest in system design and experimental work.

The scholarship meets the full tuition fees for a period of 3.5 years, as well as a relocation allowance (up to AUD 1,500). It also provides a tax-free living allowance of AUD 32,000 per annum for 3.5 years.
